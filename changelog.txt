3/3/19
*bugfix for "distortions" in display.circle—Matlab code had an off by one error.
*Changed the line width to 2
*changed the color from grey to black
*added "ax.set_rmax(6)" to display.circle, same function as rlim([0 6]) in Matlab code
*changed initial threshold_difference to 15, and moved "threshold_difference = abs..." to the end
of the while loop. Small bugfix, but means that the program terminates when it should instead of
one iteration later.
